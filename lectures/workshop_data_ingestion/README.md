​In this hands-on workshop, we’ll learn how to build data ingestion pipelines.

​We’ll cover the following steps:

​- Extracting data from APIs, or files.
- Normalizing and loading data
​- Incremental loading
​By the end of this workshop, you’ll be able to write data pipelines like a senior data engineer: Quickly, concisely, scalable, and self-maintaining.
